<h1>WHY DOES NO ONE UNDERSTAND THE ROMEO AND JULIET TROPE?</h1>

<p> <i> PSA: This is obviously going to contain spoilers - read at your peril. Also, it is not morally wrong to enjoy the media misusing this trope - I myself sometimes enjoy things that are bad. </i> </p>

<p> Many times in my life, I have watched a piece of media with a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ style love story. Romance is triumphing against a seemingly insurmountable divide and it should be beautiful. Unfortunately, many times in my life, I have found myself wondering, why does this feel so off? This, I believe, stems from writers ignoring two of the key facets of Romeo and Juliet’s relationship.</p>


<p> Briefly, for me, a ‘Romeo and Juliet’ style romance is one where two characters fall in love despite being from opposite sides of some kind of feud or conflict. I will give bonus points for this relationship ending in tragedy. For those unfamiliar, (probably read a book icl), Romeo is a Montague, so comes from a family which has an “ancient grudge” against the Capulets - who grudge them right back. Juliet is a Capulet, so that’s where the tension is. (They are also both in their teens but we will be mostly ignoring that.) Now, the key aspects of this feud, that I think are often missed, are equality and folly. </p>


<p> I will begin with equality. The Capulets and Montagues are noble families, famously ‘both alike in dignity.’ It is a play about peer on peer brutality - “where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.” I cannot stress enough how key this is, but please keep reading to hear about it being ignored literally every time. </p>


<p> The other aspect is folly. Romeo and Juliet are “star-cross'd” which is a lovely way of saying unlucky. There is no sensible reason why their love can’t be, instead it is their bad luck to be born into unnecessarily feuding families. The first scene of the play has a Capulet and a Montague come to blows over whether or not one is biting his thumb at the expense of the other. This is meant to be silly, and crucially it is meant to be silly on both sides. No one should be biting their thumb, and no one should be angry about thumb biting. </p>


<p> What needs to be able to happen at the end of a story with the Romeo-Juliet trope, is that the couple themselves or the groups they belong to realise they are equally at fault in a conflict that is ultimately silly and pointless. This realisation is of course inspired by the beautiful love story and perhaps its tragic end.</p>


 <p>The challenge that I think writers are experiencing is that it is hard to modernise this sort of noble family grouping. Individualism and the loss of a ‘noble-class’ means we don’t recognise these powerful family units, so writers have had to come up with other ways to create this dynamic. </p>


<p> <i>Honourable mentions for Teen Beach Movie and Gnomeo & Juliet which do have silly feuds between genuine peer groups. However, I will say this is partially made possible because, being children’s films, they aren’t constrained by any kind of realism. This means they don’t have to come up with a truly plausible feud.</i> </p>


<p> I am going to roughly structure this post from least terrible to most terrible Romeo and Juliet adaptations. </p>


<p> The first way I have seen this trope modernised is through political stance. This does not work. Politics is deeply connected with inequality so the characters are not “both alike in dignity.” It is next to impossible that two people, from truly opposite sides, will be equally politically empowered. Additionally, politics is not trivial. We don’t understand why the Montagues and Capulets are fighting, but if you’re fighting about politics then you have deeply felt differences about how society should operate. If at the end of it, you think it was silly that you were ever fighting - then probably you didn’t feel that strongly in the first place.</p>


<p> A good modern example of this is the film Purple Hearts. I am full of self-love so I have not re-watched this film, but I will speak on it with confidence nonetheless. Cassie is ‘woke’, she is a liberal singer-songwriter who is anti-military and the daughter of an undocumented migrant. Enter her love interest, Luke, a staunchly conservative soldier. This film combines the Romeo-Juliet trope with the ‘fake relationship becomes real’ trope. </p>


<p> Cassie is diabetic and cannot afford the insulin she needs, so agrees to marry Luke in order to access the health insurance given to military spouses. An attempt is made here at creating equality. Cassie is vulnerable because she is poor and unwell, and Luke is vulnerable because he is a recovered drug addict. He agrees to the fake marriage to access the higher pay, for soldiers with families, so he can pay off his former drug dealer who is blackmailing him. I would argue this does not really work. Cassie is in the financial situation she is in because of a political system which commercialises healthcare and penalises people from her background, something it’s clear Luke is voting for. Luke’s problems are not at all connected with Cassie’s actions or beliefs. So they are not equals. </p>


<p> Throughout the film we see an imbalance of power in the relationship. Most obviously, Luke has strongly held views about ‘illegal immigrants’ which is what he’d consider Cassie’s mother. The couple’s differences extend to the soldiers as a group. Cassie and her colleague wait tables, and are sexually harassed by Luke’s soldier peers. Whilst Luke apologises to Cassie for this, he makes excuses, saying that the boys need to blow off steam. Cassie is forced, as a server, to accept this, Luke as the customer being served holds the power. Later, one of Luke’s friends makes a cheerful toast at a party, and says ‘let’s go kill some Arabs’. Cassie is naturally upset by this, but once again the behaviour is mildly criticised and then excused as blowing off steam. Cassie later that day has her first romantic moment with Luke, defusing the tension. The soldiers are never held accountable, and Luke is never really challenged for his role in this. </p>


<p> Long story short, a war injury sends Luke home early and they are forced to live as an actual married couple. Cassie finds commercial musical success writing military love songs about wanting Luke home safe. Additionally, Cassie, having been uncomfortable with the soldier group, learns to empathise with them and view them with compassion because of her newfound understanding of the peril they face. </p>


<p> For Cassie there is a major political shift. By the end of the film she is softened, no longer out-spoken and certainly no-longer anti-military. The feud ends, but in a way that is onesided. The shifts Luke makes are less ideological - he learns to open up and be cared for.  This could be seen as moving away from conservatism, by relaxing on traditional masculinity. However, it could also be seen as literally the basics of being in a relationship. What we never see is him expressing that he thinks the love of his life Cassie should have free access to insulin, or that her hard-working, tax-paying mother should remain in the country that she raised her daughter in. </p>


<p> In summary, are Cassie and Luke equals? No, Cassie’s problems are created by a system that Luke works to preserve. Is the feud silly? Well, whilst Cassie’s development could indicate that she decides it’s silly to let politics stand in the way of love, the fact that she spends half the film on the verge of death and/or bankruptcy because she’s diabetic offers a hard to ignore counter-argument. That in my view is why the trope fails here. </p>


<p> I spent ages on that so I will try to now be more concise. I will describe an even more egregious example. If I had a nickel for every time a TV show had an Irish Republican activist fall for a member of the British upper classes, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice. There is Downton Abbey where Tom Branson, an Irish republican and socialist falls in love with Lady Sybil. Then there is the new House of Guinness where Fenian Brotherhood member Ellen Cochrane falls for Edward Guinness. </p>


<p> In Downton Abbey, there is some rebelling, on Sybil’s part, against her family’s politics. There is also some Shakespearian tragedy with Sybil dying in childbirth. However, once again this is not a conflict of equals. Sybil belongs to a group with direct power over Tom. In fact, he is literally her actual servant, being the family chauffeur. Additionally, whilst there’s some rebelling on Sybil’s part, it is Tom who, much like Cassie, truly shifts. He becomes part of the Downton Abbey family. What had been core facets of his identity, Irish republicanism and socialism, become more like awkward small talk at dinner parties. In fact, by the end of the franchise he has literally saved the British monarch from an assassination attempt. It is not a trivial feud, what he stands for initially, is the dismantling of the system that has created Downton Abbey. Hence he has to essentially abandon these views, not because they’re silly or even really for love, but because it is simpler for the plot. </p>


<p> What I will say in favour of the House of Guinness storyline is that there is a recognition that Edward Guiness, a pro-Union businessman, would abandon his republican lover for a more respectable marriage. However, he nonetheless remains in love with her, and more ridiculously she does with him. They are not equals. Edward describes how Ellen lives in a slum where the smoke of the factory he owns blackens her clothes. In this situation, Ellen never comes to the conclusion that the divide between them is silly, and they need to set aside their differences because of true love. She remains a socialist, and Edward remains a capitalist, albeit a charitable one. She remains a republican, and Edward remains a unionist, albeit with some self-serving flexibility. However, Ellen does help Edward get out of difficulty with the Fenian brotherhood, acting against the interests of her cause. This is a cause she goes to prison for, she sees her brother go to prison for, and she sees her peers die for. Whatever your stance on it, it is certainly not trivial and clearly not for her. </p>


<p> If these characters’ politics is as core to their identity as it is framed, then it would be practically impossible for them to fall for someone that stands so completely against these views. Nevertheless they do, because of course the British upper class are really hot and charming. What we see here is a lack of equality in these relationships. More significantly, it is a genuine ideological divide being trivialised, instead of a divide between the lovers that is at its core trivial. The moral of Romeo and Juliet falls short here because there remain significant political questions to be answered. </p>


<p> The other, and even worse offender for modernising the Romeo-Juliet trope, is making it about racism. It almost works, because of course being racist is a stupid thing to do. Much like it is stupid for the Montagues and Capulets to hate each other. However, it is not stupid for the victim of racism to hate racists. It is also not the case that racists and their victims are equals. </p>


<p> The most famous example of this, and probably the most famous Romeo and Juliet adaptation overall is West Side Story. For transparency, I enjoy this musical and I like the songs. I also think that gang violence is a good idea for a Romeo and Juliet adaptation. Its connection with youth works well, and there could plausibly be two equally at fault gangs. There are allusions to this in Baz Luhrmann’s film version of the Shakespeare play. However, that’s not what’s happening here. The grudge in Romeo and Juliet is ‘ancient’ and its cause is unknown. Not so, for the Sharks and Jets. The Jets are a gang of white youths, and the Sharks are Puerto Rican. There’s a back and forth between Bernardo (Shark leader) and Riff (Jets leader) litigating who began the feud. After discussions of various fights, Bernardo asks “Who jumped me the first day I moved here?” to which Riff responds “Who asked you to move here?” </p>


<p> Maria, Bernardo’s sister, falls for Tony, Riff’s best friend. The film closely mirrors the plot of Romeo and Juliet. Where Romeo kills Tybalt, Juliet’s cousin, Tony kills Bernardo, Maria’s brother. However, where Romeo is avenging his best friend Mercutio whose death is from a fight literally blamed on hot weather. Tony is avenging Riff, his best friend who has been making racially aggravated attacks on Bernardo literally since the day he moved to town. That is why, at the end of the musical when the Sharks and Jets lay down their weapons to mourn their dead, it feels different. The Montagues and Capulets are equals in status, and equals in blame. They don’t remember why they took up arms in the first place, but the Sharks were forced to take up arms to protect themselves from the Jets. </p>


<p> The reprise of the song ‘Tonight’ has the Sharks and Jets preparing for a fight, both singing the same or similar lines. Both sing ‘well they began it!’ but of course the Jets began it. I will say that what I think the musical seeks to convey is that the Jets didn’t exactly begin it. After being called ‘spics’ a slur on Latinos, the Sharks call the Jets ‘Wops’ and ‘Mics’ alluding to their immigrant backgrounds. It is likely that the Jets or their families experienced discrimination for coming from Ireland and Italy, as these insults imply, so have a backstory akin to the Sharks. They also have many lines and songs, alluding to the Jets’ poverty and difficult homelifes. It is implied that this is the root cause of their behaviour. This is particularly clear in the song ‘Officer Krupke’ where the Jets sing “It's just our bringin' up-ke That gets us out of hand.” However, crucially the Jets as white Americans occupy a less marginalised position than the Sharks. They use this to brutalise the Sharks, as a means of empowering themselves. Yet the song ‘tonight’ frames them as equal participants. For example, both describe contingency plans, bringing knives in case the fight escalates. This suggests they are peers whose mutual mistrust is the driver of the conflict. </p>


<p> This is very similar to the song ‘Savages’ in Disney’s Pocahontas. Both the indigenous characters, and the English invaders march towards a battle, singing a song calling the other side ‘savages.’ Most obviously, this seems like an odd choice because of the real historical precedent of colonialists calling indigenous Americans ‘savages’ to justify brutalising them. In addition, this creates another false framing of the sides as equal participants. The audience feels both groups should abandon their differences to allow the love between Pocahontas and John Smith to flourish. Yet one side is a violent colonial invader, and the other side is the group whose home is being invaded. Is it really two equals? Even in terms of weaponry, the English men have guns that the indigenous tribe simply do not have. Is it a feud that is folly? It seems legitimate that the tribe should want to defend their home. To avoid tackling this, the English men sail home at the end of the film. There is no need to truly reckon with which side is at fault, and an individual Englishman is villanised and treated as the cause of the conflict. Of course the audience knows that there is more to that story, or they would if they were not children watching a Disney film. </p>


<p> Finally, the most egregious version of this trope I have ever seen comes in the film Where Hands Touch. This depicts a black girl, being raised by her white German mother, falling in love with a Nazi. Some of it literally takes place in a concentration camp. I will not dignify this film, or disrespect you, with my analysis. Needless to say it makes no fucking sense. </p>


<p> A Romeo-Juliet trope will always fall somewhat flat where it asks the audience to ignore a power imbalance or treat a prejudice as a feud with fault on both sides. </p>


<p> So then, is the Romeo and Juliet relationship impossible to recreate? Not necessarily, but is that what writers should be aiming for? I think there are ways to adapt it directly, with gang violence being the one I mentioned earlier. I also think that it is possible to depict romances which cross divides that are significant and aren’t folly. However, I think writers need to work hard and have their characters truly reckon with this. Characters with strongly held principles should have thought out reasons for changing them or they shouldn’t change. Prejudice isn’t a plot device to add tension, it is a real and pressing issue. If it is in your story then you need to think carefully about what you do with it. That means your romance won’t be exactly like Romeo and Juliet, and it shouldn’t be. </p>
