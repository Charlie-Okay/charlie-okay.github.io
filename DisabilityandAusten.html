<h1>INTERSECTIONAL DISABILITY THEORY IN EMMA AND MANSFIELD PARK</h1>

<p>In this essay, I will consider how Austen portrays the difference in the treatment that invalids receive based on social status, using the examples of Mansfield Park’s Fanny Price and Emma’s Mr. Woodhouse. Ula Lukszco Klein reads Fanny as a disabled figure, referring to her ‘recurring fatigue’, ‘shortness of breath’, and timidity. In Emma, Mr. Woodhouse is introduced as a ‘valetudinarian’, so Austen treats his health issues as related to hypochondria. Although, the reality of his physical frailty is called into question, since Klein reads ‘mental anxieties’ as part of Fanny’s disability, I would argue that Mr. Woodhouse still lives as an invalid through his anxiety. It should be noted that, here, I will be using invalid rather than disabled, as this was the term used in the period. Whilst I would contend that they are both invalids, Fanny and Mr. Woodhouse contrast with each other in the extent that others adapt to their needs. Austen reiterates Fanny’s fear of being ‘ungrateful’, throughout the novel, and this is an accusation often used against her, so Fanny is treated as indebted to the Bertrams. Contrastingly, Mr. Woodhouse has power within his social circle, which is explicitly tied to his ‘long residence at Hartfield’ and his ‘fortune’. Therefore, I will argue that Austen presents Mr. Woodhouse as occupying a privileged position, where Fanny does not. </p>
    <p>Klein argues that the Bertrams treat Fanny as ‘a servant or commodity'. This relates to her invalidism, as, to continue using Fanny in this way, the Bertrams are necessarily inconsiderate of her physical limitations. This is evident in the passage where Fanny suffers a headache after working all day. This section begins with Fanny lying on the sofa which Austen has Mrs. Norris criticise, demanding that Fanny do some sewing. Mrs Norris exclaims ‘I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out’ and calls it ‘a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a sofa’. Austen’s use of the word ‘trick’ is significant because it implies deception. In reality though, it is Mrs Norris who is playing a ‘trick’, by leveraging her own false claim of physical frailty, a broken ‘back’, against Fanny whose genuine physical limitations are being ignored. John Wiltshire argues that in Austen’s novels she ‘observes the way people use physical symptoms for the purposes of social advantage’. Here Mrs. Norris uses her social power, creating ‘physical symptoms’, to aid her demands on Fanny. Austen dismisses Mrs. Norris’ accusation that Fanny is ‘always lolling about’, revealing that she had ‘cut the roses’ and walked to Mrs. Norris’ house twice. When Edmund defends Fanny, criticising Mrs. Norris and Lady Bertram for working her so hard and causing her headache, they abdicate responsibility. Lady Bertram explains that Fanny had to go to Mrs Norris’ home twice because ‘unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the key, so she was obliged to go again’. Here Lady Bertram uses the language of chance, ‘unluckily’, to divorce herself and her sister from their control of the situation. Furthermore, Austen uses passive language, Fanny ‘was obliged’, reflecting how Lady Bertram obscures the power she and her sister have. The word ‘obliged’ also conveys the pressure on Fanny. Austen presents Fanny as having no choice but to fulfil the tasks demanded of her, despite her invalidism.  </p>
    <p>Fanny’s servile relationship to the Bertrams also intersects with her timidity, which as Klein argues, forms part of her invalidism through the disabling nature of her anxiety. Fanny’s social anxiety is clear from the moment of her introduction, where Austen calls her ‘exceedingly timid’. Nonetheless, when Sir Thomas returns from Antigua, at the midpoint of the novel, Fanny is faced with pressure to entertain the patriarch of the family. Edmund tells her 'Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I only wish you would talk to him more’. Fanny is expected to fulfil her duty, as a woman and a dependent, by supplying her uncle with entertainment through ‘talk’. Her lack of ‘talk[ing]’ can be understood as a symptom of her social anxiety. Notably, Austen does not describe Fanny’s uncle as ‘pleased’ with her, but instead ‘disposed’ to be pleased, conveying the expectation put on Fanny to earn his approval. Edmund’s phrasing of the idea that Fanny should speak more, is disingenuous. It is framed as merely a desire, but, when seen through the context of this pressure that Fanny is facing, it becomes a demand rather than a ‘wish’. Austen’s use of the word ‘only', suggests that Edmund is downplaying his demand that Fanny talk more. Since Austen has established Fanny’s timidity, this minimization reflects that, like his aunt and mother earlier, Edmund is making demands of Fanny which he knows she will struggle to fulfil, whilst concealing his culpability for this. This is made more poignant by his previous role as Fanny’s defender, and the context that Fanny is in love with him. Fanny defends herself, responding 'But I do talk to him more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you hear me ask him about the slave-trade last night?'. The fact that this defence is framed as a question reflects Edmund’s power. This is due partially to the fact that Fanny is in love with her cousin, so their dynamic is influenced by her desire for him and his approval. However, his higher rank is also significant. In having Fanny defer to what Edmund ‘hear[d]’, Austen conveys the greater weight put on his perception. The passage reveals that, despite her anxiety, Fanny must socialise on the Bertrams’ terms. </p>
 <p>Perhaps the most significant way Fanny’s social status and invalidism interact, is their role in her future. Fanny is treated as owing it to the Bertrams to marry Henry Crawford. To pressure her into this marriage, her uncle, Sir Thomas, sends her back to her immediate family in Portsmouth. Austen describes how he ‘wished her to be heartily sick of home before her visit ended’. It is evident that Fanny’s status as a lower-ranking woman compounds with her frailty to leave her especially vulnerable to pressure from her relatives. The fact that Austen describes Portsmouth as ‘home’, reflects the precarity of Fanny’s situation. She is excluded from claiming Mansfield as her ‘home’, exposing that she cannot overcome her lower-ranking origin and be safely considered a genuine part of the Bertram family. Klein close reads this section, arguing that Sir Thomas literally ‘wants Fanny to become “sick”’. Klein is right to highlight the connotations of Austen’s use of ‘sick’, as Austen reveals that Fanny’s frailty does mean that her health deteriorates from the harsher conditions in Portsmouth. Eventually, Henry Crawford’s affair with Fanny’s cousin, which renders him undesirable to the Bertrams, means it becomes possible for Fanny to return home, and she is able to marry Edmund. The fact that Fanny manages to avoid the marriage her relatives try to pressure her into, marrying the man she truly desired instead, might suggest that Fanny is finally afforded autonomy. However, Austen’s framing of this final marriage would suggest otherwise. Austen describes Fanny’s ‘mind’ as ‘in so great degree formed by [Edmund’s] care, and her comfort depending on his kindness’. This connects to gender, as Fanny is seen as an ideal wife due to her submissiveness. Her ‘mind’ is explicitly characterised as ‘formed’ by Edmund. Notably, Austen makes clear that Fanny remains ‘depend[ent]’. Austen’s description of Fanny’s ‘comfort’ as ‘depending’ on Edmund, suggests that she will continue to live her life on a Bertram’s terms. Whilst Edmund has been mindful of Fanny’s frailty previously, the reader is still left to trust that he will remain considerate, having not always been so. In describing Fanny as ‘depending’ on Edmund, Austen conveys that she has not necessarily gained autonomy. </p>
 <p>Mr Woodhouse is a contrast to Fanny in terms of his power over his social sphere. Kathleen James-Cavan argues that ‘Rather than being made a spectacle against which normalcy may be measured, Mr. Woodhouse successfully makes his definition of normal the standard’. This is reflected in the way that the other characters adapt to his needs, so that his social demands are normalised. Austen describes how ‘his horror of late hours, and of large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms’. Austen’s use of dramatic language, with the word ‘horror’, conveys the intensity of his anxiety. The comic contrast between this and the light-hearted image of ‘dinner parties’, creates a sense of unseriousness in his health anxiety. This unseriousness is reiterated later when Austen describes that Mr. Woodhouse is always occupied ‘unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company’. Here the word ‘fancied’ implies fancifulness, suggesting that his invalidism is to some degree illusory. Mr. Woodhouse’s ability to fancy himself unable reflects his privileged position, whereas Fanny is often made to ignore her genuine frailty. Mr Woodhouse, unlike Fanny, can ‘command the visits of his own little circle’. Here the word ‘command’, particularly when contrasted with the diminutive ‘little’, conveys his power. Hence, those around him must adapt to his invalidism. Austen uses a number of possessive phrases throughout the passage, describing how Mr. Woodhouse enjoys socialising ‘in his own way’, and can engage with people on ‘his own terms’. This use of possessives reiterates the sense of Mr Woodhouse’s power. He is positioned as in ownership of his social sphere.</p>
 <p>James-Cavan argues, ‘even outside his home, [Mr. Woodhouse’s] habits and inclinations direct social arrangements’. Hence, when visiting Mr. Knightley, he is ‘safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party’. Here, even though it is an ‘al-fresco’ occasion, Mr. Woodhouse’s needs are adapted to in order to ensure he can participate. There is a hint of comedy in the description of him being ‘safely’ transported, which again suggests danger in a harmless social engagement. This is added to by the idea that he is ‘partak[ing]’ in the ‘al-fresco’ nature of the event, even though Austen reveals that he has only braved opening ‘one window’. This comic tone suggests that Mr. Woodhouse is being overzealous in the protection of his health. Whereas, often, Fanny’s physical and emotional limitations are ignored, and she is allowed to socialise only on the terms of others. This reflects their difference in status as, where Fanny must acquiesce to the desires of her higher-ranking relatives, Mr. Woodhouse can expect to direct social arrangements, even where not entirely necessary. Mr. Woodhouse is given ‘one of the most comfortable rooms, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning’. This demonstrates Knightley’s affection for Mr. Woodhouse, displaying his thoughtfulness. Furthermore, the fact that the room is ‘one of the most comfortable’ reflects Mr. Woodhouse’s status, as it is seen as necessary to place him in one of the best rooms. In an earlier chapter, Knightley finds himself ‘irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse’s tender habits required’. Here, Austen uses the language of illness to stress the severity of Knightley’s discomfort from the fire, though it should be noted, in that scene, he was also otherwise upset. Austen writes that ‘he soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey’. Therefore, in heating Donwell Abbey by fire, Mr. Knightley removes its ‘coolness’, so makes his home suited to Mr Woodhouse, even above himself.</p>
<p>The ending of Emma takes what James-Cavan argues, about Mr. Woodhouse directing social arrangements, to the extreme, with his needs as an invalid dictating his future as well as his daughter’s. Mr. Knightley wishes to marry Emma, but struggles ‘to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father’. Austen’s use of the word ‘attacking’ equates the marriage to physically harming Mr. Woodhouse, reflecting how his emotional fragility is treated as akin to physical vulnerability. Austen writes that whilst Emma’s ‘dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her’. The fact that Austen includes the word ‘dear’ conveys that Mr. Woodhouse is considered blameless. His hindrance of his daughter’s happiness does not impact her affection for him. This reflects his privileged position. As a dependent, Fanny is shamed for not marrying as the Bertrams wished for her, whereas it is treated as literally ‘impossible’ that the Woodhouses’ situation could change. This reflects both Mr. Woodhouse’s power as the patriarch of the family, but also that he and his family are limited by his invalidism. Mr. Knightley considers that Mr. Woodhouse be moved with Emma to Donwell Abbey but concludes that ‘such a transplantation would be a risk of her father’s comfort, perhaps even of his life’. Here Austen suggests a threat to Mr. Woodhouse’s life, reiterating his fragility. However, notably, where Fanny’s living situation is at the mercy of her family, Mr. Woodhouse’s ‘comfort’ remains paramount. When it finally is agreed that Mr. Knightley will live with them at Hartfield, it is because of Mr. Woodhouse’s needs. He hears of poultry sheds being pilfered, and his fear means that the ‘strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence’. Austen’s word ‘dependence’ might suggest a disempowerment for Mr. Woodhouse, akin to Fanny’s. However, Austen stresses that the situation is arranged with Mr. Woodhouse’s ‘voluntary, cheerful consent’, so Mr. Woodhouse’s autonomy and satisfaction in the situation is given the final emphasis.</p>
<p>To conclude, through examining the characters of Fanny and Mr. Woodhouse as examples of invalidism, it is possible to gain an understanding of how Austen responds to the privilege conveyed on individuals by social position and gender. As a dependent woman, Fanny is forced to live according to the needs and desires of the Bertrams, even where her frailty makes this painful. However, Mr. Woodhouse, although he might be seen as weak and comical, never loses control over his fate, and even, to some degree, the fates of those around him. Therefore, Austen reveals, in these novels, how decisive social status is in determining the comfort of invalids.</p>
